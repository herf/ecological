*Data and runtime for Longcore et al. "Rapid Assessment of Lamp Spectrum to Quantify Ecological Effects of Light at Night"*

We have provided here (in .CSV form) a list of SPDs and action spectra used in making the graphs for the above paper.

Also provided is a simple Javascript runtime for calculating responses, which makes for a free way to reproduce the results that can run in any web browser.

Demo at https://fluxometer.com/ecological/

You can sync this repository and add your own CSV data in place of the SPD file.
